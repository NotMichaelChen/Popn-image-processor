# Popn-image-processor

Pop'n image processor (or PIP) takes images of Pop'n Music charts from [this website](http://hellwork.jp/popn/wiki/) and converts them into .osu files. 

In addition to the actual image file, PIP requires a pre-timed .osu file to write to. This is needed to determine offset and bpm when writing to the .osu file.
